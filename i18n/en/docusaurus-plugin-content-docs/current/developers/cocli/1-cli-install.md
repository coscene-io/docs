:::tip

Login and initialize coCLI needs the following info:

- A personal access token(Token):
- A default working project's slug(Slug):

:::

## Login

You can generate your access token on the [coScene - My Settings](https://coscene.cn/profile?section=security) page.

The CLI tool also requires you to specify a default project as the default environment for all operations. Please select the project you want to work on and get the project slug from the URL.

### Configure CLI Permissions

```Bash
# Replace <project slug> after -p
# Replace <personal access token> after -t
cocli login set -p <PROJECT_SLUG> -t <TOKEN>
```

:::info
If your are an Enterprise user with an on-premise instance, you will have to
specify your instance's endpoint

eg. https://server2.coscene.cn -> https://openapi.server2.coscene.cn

```bash
cocli login set -p <PROJECT_SLUG> -t <TOKEN> -e <ENDPOINT>
```

:::

## Switch Default Project

After successfully authenticating the CLI, you can use the command line to switch the default working project. First, we can list all the projects in the organization that the user has access to, along with their corresponding project slugs:

```bash
cocli project list
```

```bash
ID                                       SLUG
43f54f09-3164-4e30-80a8-c63e25ca81af     starbase
3f09b8b5-3b31-436e-9232-0a8ffbc298da     mcap
```

After finding the target project, use `cocli login set` to update the default working project. If needed, you can use `cocli login current` to confirm.

```bash
cocli login set -p mcap
```

```bash
Profile set successful.
Current Profile is:
Profile Name:        saas
Endpoint:            https://openapi.coscene.cn
Organization:        coscene-lark
Default Project:     mcap
```

```bash
cocli login current
```

```bash
Current Profile:
Profile Name:        saas
Endpoint:            https://openapi.coscene.cn
Organization:        coscene-lark
Default Project:     mcap
```
