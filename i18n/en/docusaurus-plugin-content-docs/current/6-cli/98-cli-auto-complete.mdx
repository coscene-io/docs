# Auto-completion

coCLI provides auto-completion functionality for Bash and Zsh, which can save you a lot of typing.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="zsh" label="Zsh" default>
        cocli generates Zsh auto-completion script using the `cocli completion zsh` command. Sourcing this auto-completion script in your Shell will enable cocli auto-completion functionality.

        To enable this feature in all Shell sessions, add the following content to your `~/.zshrc` file:

        ```Bash
        source <(cocli completion zsh)
        ```

        After reloading the Shell, cocli auto-completion will take effect immediately.

        If you receive an error like `2: command not found: compdef`, add the following content to the beginning of your `~/.zshrc` file:

        ```Bash
        autoload -Uz compinit
        compinit
        ```

        The Bash completion script for cocli can be generated using the `cocli completion bash` command. Sourcing this script in your Shell will enable the completion functionality.

        Additionally, the cocli completion script depends on **[bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion)**, so you must install it first.

        **Warning:**

        There are two versions of bash-completion: v1 and v2. v1 corresponds to Bash 3.2 (which is the default on macOS), while v2 corresponds to Bash 4.1+. cocli's completion script **does not work** with bash-completion v1 and Bash 3.2. It requires **bash-completion v2** and **Bash 4.1+**. Therefore, to use cocli completion on macOS, you must install and use Bash 4.1+. The following instructions assume you're using Bash 4.1+ (that is, Bash 4.1 or later).

        #### Upgrading Bash

        The following instructions assume you're using Bash 4.1+. You can check your Bash version by running:

        ```Bash
        echo $BASH_VERSION
        ```

        If the version is too old, you can install/upgrade using Homebrew:

        ```Bash
        brew install bash
        ```

        Reload your Shell and verify that the required version is in effect:

        ```Bash
        echo $BASH_VERSION $SHELL
        ```

        Homebrew typically installs it as `${brew --prefix}/bin/bash`.

        #### Installing bash-completion

        **Note:**

        As mentioned earlier, these instructions assume you're using Bash 4.1+, which means you need to install bash-completion v2 (unlike Bash 3.2 and bash-completion v1, where cocli completion won't work).

        You can test if bash-completion v2 is installed with `type _init_completion`. If not installed, install it using Homebrew:

        ```Bash
        brew install bash-completion@2
        ```

        As shown in the command output, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`:

        ```Bash
        brew_etc="$(brew --prefix)/etc" && [[ -r "${brew_etc}/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "${brew_etc}/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
        ```

        Reload your Shell and verify bash-completion v2 is properly installed using `type _init_completion`.

        #### Enabling cocli auto-completion

        You now need to ensure the cocli completion script is sourced in all Shell environments. There are several ways to do this:

        - Source the completion script in `~/.bash_profile`:

        ```Bash
        echo 'source <(cocli completion bash)' >>~/.bash_profile
        ```

        - Add the completion script to `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d`:

        After reloading the Shell, cocli auto-completion will take effect. To enable Bash completion in the current Shell session, source the `~/.bashrc` file:

        ```Bash
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

      <TabItem value="zsh" label="Zsh" default>
        
        cocli generates Zsh auto-completion script using the `cocli completion zsh` command. Sourcing this auto-completion script in your Shell will enable cocli auto-completion functionality.

        To enable this feature in all Shell sessions, add the following content to your `~/.zshrc` file:

        ```Bash
        source <(cocli completion zsh)
        ```

        After reloading the Shell, cocli auto-completion will take effect immediately.

        If you receive an error like `2: command not found: compdef`, add the following content to the beginning of your `~/.zshrc` file:

        ```Bash
        autoload -Uz compinit
        compinit
        ```

      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">

        The Bash completion script for cocli can be generated using `cocli completion bash`. Sourcing the completion script in your Shell will enable cocli auto-completion functionality.

        However, the completion script depends on **[bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion)**, so you must install it first (you can check if bash-completion is installed using `type _init_completion`).

        #### Installing bash-completion

        Many package managers support bash-completion (see [here](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion#installation)). You can install it using `apt-get install bash-completion` or `yum install bash-completion`, etc.

        These commands will create `/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`, which is the main script for bash-completion. Depending on your package manager, you may need to manually source this file in your `~/.bashrc`.

        To see the result, reload your Shell and run `type _init_completion`. If the command succeeds, you're done, otherwise add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:

        ```Bash
        source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
        ```

        Reload your Shell and run `type _init_completion` again to verify bash-completion installation.

        #### Enabling cocli auto-completion

        You now need to ensure that the cocli completion script is sourced in your Shell session. This can be done in two ways:

        1. For current user

        ```Bash
        echo 'source <(cocli completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
        ```

        2. System-wide

        ```Bash
        cocli completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/cocli > /dev/null
        sudo chmod a+r /etc/bash_completion.d/cocli
        ```

        **Note:**

        bash-completion sources all completion scripts from the `/etc/bash_completion.d` directory.

        Both methods have the same effect. After reloading the Shell, cocli auto-completion will take effect. To enable Bash completion in the current Shell session, source the `~/.bashrc` file:

        ```Bash
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```
