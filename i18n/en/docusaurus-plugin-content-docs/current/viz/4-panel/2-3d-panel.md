# 3D Panel

The "3D Panel" is a panel that displays markers, entities, camera images, meshes, URDF models, etc., in a 3D scene. This panel provides a rich visual and interactive experience, allowing for intuitive display and manipulation of 3D objects.

## Properties in the 3D Panel

Click the "3D Panel" and then click the **Panel** button in the left sidebar. The "3D Panel" interface includes: Reference Frames, Scene, View, Transform, Topics, Custom Layers, and Publish Properties.

### Frames

"Frames" are coordinate systems used to define the position and orientation of data and objects in 3D visualization. They provide a common baseline for all elements in the scene, ensuring that various data can be correctly displayed and interacted with in the same space.

![viz-5-2-Eng](../img/viz-5-2-Eng.png)

#### Display Frames

1. **map**: Commonly used as the global coordinate system, based on the map, suitable for displaying global positioning data.
2. **base_link**: Reference frame based on the robot or vehicle's center point, usually located at the vehicle's geometric center, suitable for displaying data relative to the vehicle's position and movement.
3. **CAM**: Camera data from different positions on the vehicle.
4. **LIDAR**: LIDAR data from different positions on the vehicle.

#### Follow Mode

"Follow Mode" defines how the view follows the selected reference frame, including three modes: Attitude, Position, and Fixed.

1. **Pose**: The view follows changes in the reference frame's position and orientation. If the reference frame rotates or moves, the view also rotates and moves accordingly.

    ![viz-5-3-Eng](../img/viz-5-3-Eng.png)

2. **Position**: The view only follows changes in the reference frame's position, not its orientation.

    ![viz-5-4-Eng](../img/viz-5-4-Eng.png)

3. **Fixed**: The view does not follow any changes in the reference frame, keeping the perspective fixed.

### Scene

The "Scene" is the overall environment in the 3D visualization interface used to configure and display data. It customizes and optimizes the display effect of data by adjusting render statistics, background, label scale, ignore COLLADA, and grid up axis attributes.

- **Render Stats**: Show or hide rendering statistics, enabling this option can display current rendering frame rates and other performance metrics.

    ![viz-5-6-Eng](../img/viz-5-6-Eng.png)

- **Background**: Set the background color of the scene to enhance contrast and visualization effect.

    ![viz-5-7-Eng](../img/viz-5-7-Eng.png)

- **Label Scale**: Adjust the scale size of labels displayed in the scene.

    ![viz-5-8-Eng](../img/viz-5-8-Eng.png)

- **Ignore COLLADA**: Choose whether to ignore the rendering of COLLADA models to speed up rendering or avoid unnecessary model displays.

- **Mesh Up Axis**: Set the up axis direction of the grid in the scene, affecting the coordinate system direction of the entire scene.

    ![viz-5-9-Eng](../img/viz-5-9-Eng.png)

### View

"View" is a functional module in 3D visualization for setting and adjusting camera angles and display parameters. By adjusting different properties in the view, users can achieve better data display effects.

![viz-5-10-Eng](../img/viz-5-10-Eng.png)

- **Sync Camera**: Synchronize the view with other views, facilitating linked observation of data across multiple views.
- **Distance**: Adjust the distance between the camera and the target object to zoom in or out.
- **Perspective**: Enabling perspective applies a near-large, far-small perspective effect, making the 3D scene more realistic.
- **Target X, Y, Z**: Adjust the target position coordinates of the camera to change its focus position.
- **Theta**: The angle of rotation around the target point to adjust the camera's vertical rotation.
- **Phi**: The horizontal rotation angle around the target point to adjust the camera's left-right rotation.
- **Y-Axis FOV**: Adjust the vertical field of view angle of the camera.
- **Near**: Adjust the nearest visible distance in the camera view.
- **Far**: Adjust the farthest visible distance in the camera view.

### Transforms

"Transforms" is used to adjust the position, rotation, and scaling of objects in 3D space, ensuring they are correctly displayed and operated within the 3D panel.

    - **Rotation (R, P, Y)**: Adjust the rotation on the roll, pitch, and yaw angles.

        ![viz-5-13-Eng](../img/viz-5-13-Eng.png)

### Topics

"Topics" refer to the categories or channels of data streams. Each topic represents a specific type of data source or sensor data, such as camera images, LIDAR data, annotation information, etc.

![viz-5-14-Eng](../img/viz-5-14-Eng.png)

#### Filter List

"Filter List" is used to control and manage the topics displayed on the user interface. Users can list all topics, visible topics, and invisible topics.

#### Topic Classifications and Meanings

- **Camera Data**: Represents calibration information and compressed image data from cameras at different positions. Users can click on camera data topics to adjust their visualization parameters.
  - **Distance**: Set the distance from the camera to the target object.
  - **Plane Projection Factor**: Adjust the projection ratio of the image in the 3D scene, affecting how the image fits onto the plane in the scene.
