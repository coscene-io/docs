# File Preparation

After creating a Record, upload Bag / Mcap format files and other necessary files for playback.
Note: For detailed steps on creating a Record and uploading files, refer to [Upload Files](../collaboration/record/2-upload-files.md).

## Managing File Media Types

For data lacking map and static TF information:
1. Copy the bag file containing such information into the corresponding Record and set it as a Static Bag (only using map and coordinate data during playback without playing the file).
2. Manually import map and coordinate files.
3. Extract map and static coordinates from the Record file.

### Setting a Static Bag

1. Upload the static bag containing this information.
