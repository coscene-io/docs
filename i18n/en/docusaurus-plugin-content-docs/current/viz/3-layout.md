## Recommended Layouts

"Recommended Layouts" are preset and suggested layout types, including **Organization Recommended Layouts** and **Project Recommended Layouts**.

### Organization Recommended
> Only organization administrators can configure

Newly created projects will automatically use the "Organization Recommended Layout" as the "Project Recommended Layout". When project members play a record without any available layouts, the project layout will be used by default.

You can access **Layout Configuration** in **Organization Management** from the avatar menu to select the recommended layout for your organization.

### Project Recommended
> Only project administrators and higher roles can configure

When project members play a record without any available layouts, the project layout will be used by default.

You can access **Layout Configuration** in **Project Settings** to select the recommended layout for your project.

### Record Recommended
The "Record Recommended Layout" is the default layout for a record. When any user plays this record, this layout will be used.

In the visualization page, right-click the layout you want to set in the **Layout Menu** and click "Copy as Record Default Layout".
