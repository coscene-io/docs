# Upload Files

## 1. Upload Files from Local

You can create multi-level categorized directories under the specified upload path. Each non-empty end-level folder will correspond to a record created in the cloud. You can drag files into these folders, and the files in the folder will be automatically uploaded to the corresponding record of the folder:

![upload-file-1](../img/upload-file-1.png)

## 2. Remotely Fetch Files from Devices

If you use applications like Sunflower for remote file fetching, you can directly drag data from the device directory into the specified upload path within that application:

![upload-file-2](../img/upload-file-2.png)

## 3. View File Upload Information

You can view the uploaded file information and its upload status through the coScene Studio interface:

![upload-file-3](../img/upload-file-3.png)

Once the "Upload Status" displays "Upload Successful", the file upload is complete.

You can see the generated record and the successfully uploaded device files on the coScene web interface:

![upload-file-4](../img/upload-file-4.png)
