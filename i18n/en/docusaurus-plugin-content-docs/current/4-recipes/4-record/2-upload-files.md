# Upload Files

In coScene, there are two ways to upload files: **Local Upload and URL Upload**

## Local File Upload

Users can drag and drop files or click the [Upload File] button within a record to upload local files to the record.

## URL File Upload

Within a record, users can paste the file URL to import the remote file into the record.

Step 1: On the "Record Details Page", click the dropdown button next to the [Upload File] button to expand [URL Upload].

Step 3: After verifying the basic file information, click [Confirm] to import the file from the URL into the record.
