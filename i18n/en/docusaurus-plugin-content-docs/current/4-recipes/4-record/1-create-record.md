# Create a Record

When users need to view data generated by a device over a period of time, they can create a record within a project and upload all the data generated by the device to this record.

## 3 Ways to Create a Record

### 1. Create a Record from the Record List

Step 1: In the "Record List" within the project, click the [Create Record] button, enter the record name, and it's successfully created:

![create-record-1](../img/create-record-1.png)

Step 2: In the "Record Details Page", click [Upload File] to upload the data generated by the device from your local machine to the record.

### 2. Drag and Drop Files into the Project to Create a Record

On any page within the project, simply drag and drop files into the browser to trigger the [Create Record] action and upload the files.

### 3. Create a Record by Uploading Files via URL

coScene supports uploading files from webpage links via URL.

Step 1: In the project sidebar, click the dropdown menu next to the [Upload File] button and expand the [URL Upload] button.

<img alt="create-record-by-url-1" src={require('../img/create-record-by-url-1.png').default} width="180" />

Step 2: Click [URL Upload] to pop up the "Paste File Link" dialog.

<img alt="create-record-by-url-2" src={require('../img/create-record-by-url-2.png').default} width="180" />

<img alt="create-record-by-url-3" src={require('../img/create-record-by-url-3.png').default} width="600" />

Step 3: Paste the file link you want to upload into the input box to trigger [Create Record].

<img alt="create-record-by-url-4" src={require('../img/create-record-by-url-4.png').default} width="600" />

Step 4: Click the [Create] button. While creating the record, the file will be uploaded to the record.

<img alt="create-record-by-url-5" src={require('../img/create-record-by-url-5.png').default} width="600" />

## Record Attributes

A record can have the following attributes set for categorization and retrieval:

- Start and End Time: The start and end time of the event recorded.
- Device: You can choose from the list of already added devices, or add a new device.
- Tags: You can set category tags.
- Description: You can write a description of the scene at the time of recording, any faults, or other relevant information.
