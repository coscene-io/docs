# Manage Records

On the record list page, you can add, edit, copy, and archive previously created records. You can also search and filter records and generate statistics based on existing categories.

## Categorization and Tagging

- When creating or editing a record, you can set tags for it. Each tag can correspond to a category.
- Multiple tags can be set for each record.
