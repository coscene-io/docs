# About Automatic Data Collection and Diagnosis

Automatic Data Collection and Diagnosis is an operational service provided for device data. By predefined rules, through real-time monitoring of device logs, collecting target data, and performing automatic diagnosis, it achieves automatic analysis of device failures and early detection of potential risks.

## Basic Elements

The process of automatic data collection and diagnosis has three basic elements: trigger object, trigger condition, and post-trigger actions.

- **Trigger Object**: Logs and bag data in devices and projects
- **Trigger Condition**: Events in the logs matching predefined rules
- **Post-trigger Actions**: Uploading data, creating a moment, creating & assigning tasks, etc.

## Usage Process

1. **Configure Rules**: Define conditions for triggering data collection and diagnosis, as well as actions after the trigger.
2. **Configure Data Collection Device Information**: Define directories where the device logs to be monitored are located, directories where device information files are stored, etc.
3. **Register Device**: Register the device on the CoScene platform. Once the device is admitted, it can collect data according to the rules.
4. **View Instances**: View automatically collected data in the project, as well as diagnosis results.
