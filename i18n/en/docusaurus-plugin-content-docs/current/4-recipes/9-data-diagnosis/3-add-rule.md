# Rule-Based Collection and Diagnosis

> Rules are configured individually for each project, and only project administrators can edit.

Data collection and diagnosis rules define the conditions to trigger data collection and diagnosis, as well as the actions taken after the trigger. For example: when a certain event occurs in the device log, it automatically collects data from a specified directory, stores it as a record, and creates a moment at that point in time. The basic structure and standard format of the rules are discussed in the subsequent sections.

In the project, go to the "Manage Project - Data Collection and Diagnosis Rules" page and click on "Add Rule Group".
