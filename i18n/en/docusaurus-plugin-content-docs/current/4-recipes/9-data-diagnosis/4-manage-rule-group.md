# Managing Rule Groups

This section will explain how to manage rule groups.

## Enable

Before using a rule group, it needs to be enabled. Once a rule group is enabled, the rules within the group will then become active.
If the rules in the rule group are temporarily not needed in certain scenarios, the rule group can also be disabled.

An enabled rule group will be shown in blue in the rule group status list, while a disabled rule group will appear grayed out.

To enable/disable a rule group:

- Go to the "Manage Project - Data Collection and Diagnostic Rules" page, select the rule group, and toggle the corresponding **[Status]** button.

- Go to the "Manage Project - Data Collection and Diagnostic Rules" page, select the rule group to be edited, and click the name of the rule group (Example in image: `Demo Rule Group 2`).

- Go to the "Manage Project - Data Collection and Diagnostic Rules" page, select the rule group to be deleted, click the corresponding `...` button on the right, and choose **[Delete]**.
