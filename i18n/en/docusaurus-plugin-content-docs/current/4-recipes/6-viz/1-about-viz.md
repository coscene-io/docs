# About Data Visualization

coScene offers an efficient data visualization interface, presenting machine data as visual data through various debugging panels. Each record can be played in the visualization interface, thereby handling common machine issues.

## Basic Elements of the Visualization Interface

A visualization interface primarily comprises the following basic elements:

- Data source and other operation bars: View information about various elements in the record and carry out settings and other operations;
- Debugging panel: Show machine data from the record through 3D visualization, interactive charts, log panels, and other debugging panels;
- Timeline: The record can be played in chronological order, and during playback, you can also create a "moment" to mark a specific point in time.
