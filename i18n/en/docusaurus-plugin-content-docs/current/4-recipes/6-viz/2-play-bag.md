# Replay a ROS Bag

The visualization interface plays the entire record in the chronological order of the bag file. This section will introduce how to play the bag in the record and related settings.

## Playing the bag

> Once the bag in the record is successfully processed, it can be played.

In the visualization interface, click the "Play" icon to start playing the bag.

If there are multiple bags in the record, you can switch between them: Click on "Data Source" on the left, then "Play List", and choose the target bag to start playing from the corresponding time.
