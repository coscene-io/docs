# Add Comments to Records

After a user creates a record and completes the data upload, subsequent data processing and analysis may involve collaboration among organization members. The "comment" feature can help members post and retrieve relevant messages about a particular record, facilitating effective cooperation.

Refer to this section for detailed instructions.

## Add and Manage Comments

You can view comments related to a record in the "Comments & Tasks" section of the record details page.

Watch the video below to learn basic operations about creating, editing, and deleting comments.

In addition to text descriptions, comments also support mentioning other users with @, referencing relevant "Moments" and task links, etc. This aids collaboration with other members, enriches and refines the information, and achieves efficient work.

### Mentioning a User in Comments

You can mention other members of the organization in your comments; mentioned users will receive notifications within the organization's communication platform.
