# Create Your First "Moment"

After creating a record and uploading the BAG file, you can play it on the visualization page. While playing the BAG, you can create a keyframe "Moment". A "Moment" is coScene's basic way to analyze issues and can be a label, fault, or interesting frame in the record. You can create, edit, and share "Moments" within the visualization page.

## 1. Create a "Moment"

On the visualization page, click the "create moment" button above the playback progress bar to start the process of creating a "Moment". This allows you to mark the bag file.

## 2. View "Moments"

On the timeline, you can see all marked "Moments". In the "Moment" tab, you can view the details of the created "Moments". By clicking on a "Moment", the playback will automatically jump to the corresponding time point.

## 3. Share "Moment" Link

Click the "Copy Link" icon to easily copy the "Moment" link and share it with collaborators. Users who receive this link can directly jump to the specific frame of that "Moment" in the visualization page.
