## 2. Access Projects

Projects are the basic type for managing data in coScene. A project can be **a department, a team, or a specific topic**. On the homepage, you can view the projects in your organization that you have access to. Click to enter a project and you can access the data within it.

## 3. Create a Project

If you do not see any accessible projects in your organization after logging in, you can create a new one. Within an organization, the default visibility for newly created projects is set to be visible to all members within the organization, and they can be accessed by them.
