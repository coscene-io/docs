# Creating Your First "Moment"

While playing data in the visualization interface, you can create "moments" to quickly mark specific time periods in the multimodal data stream. These "moments" may contain important data changes, anomalies, or anything you consider worth noting. By creating "moments," you can easily review, analyze, and share this information, greatly improving the efficiency and accuracy of data processing.

## Creating a "Moment"

1. Click [Create Moment] in the lower-left corner of the visualization page, or use the shortcut [Alt + 1] (Option + 1 for Mac users) to mark the start point of a moment.

2. Click again to mark the end point of the moment. A window for creating a moment will automatically pop up, with the blue area indicating the time range of the moment.
