1. **Add Device to Project**: Enter the "Project Devices" page, click the„ÄêAdd Device„Äëbutton to select the device for data collection.

   ![add-device-to-project](./img/4-3-device-add-project-02.png)

2. **Configure Collection Directory**: Enter the organization device configuration page, set `collect_dirs` as the directories for storing data on the device, such as: `/home/bag/` and `/home/log/`.

   ![configure-collection-directory](./img/device-config_1.png)

   ```yaml
   mod:
     name: 'default'
     conf:
       enabled: true
       # Device collection directories, used as specified directories for project data collection tasks and rule collection
       collect_dirs:
         - /home/bag/
         - /home/log/
   ```

3. **Create Collection Task**: Enter the "Project-Tasks-Collection Tasks" page to create a collection task.
   - Select the device for data collection
   - Select the time range: collect files whose "file update time" is within the specified time period in the target data path
   - Target data path: default value is taken from `collect_dirs` in device configuration, or you can customize the path. If set to a folder, collect files within the time range in that folder; if set to a file, collect that file.
   - Task name: custom name

     ![create-collection-task](./img/collect_1.png)

4. **View Collection Results**: Enter the "Project-Tasks-Collection Tasks" page, click the task name to view collection results. Collected data will be automatically saved to records.

   ![view-collection-task](./img/collect_2.png)
   ![view-collection-record](./img/collect_3.png)

### Automatic Data Collection

Automatic data collection uses predefined rules to continuously monitor device logs and automatically collect relevant data when specific conditions are triggered, enabling automatic analysis of device failures and early warning of potential risks. For more details, please refer to [Data Collection & Diagnosis](../use-case/data-diagnosis/3-add-rule.md).

1. **Add Device to Project**: Enter the "Project Devices" page, click the„ÄêAdd Device„Äëbutton to select the device for data collection.

   ![add-device-to-project](./img/4-3-device-add-project-02.png)

2. **Configure Monitoring and Collection Directories**: Enter the organization device configuration page, set `listen_dirs` and `collect_dirs`

   ![configure-collection-directory](./img/device-config_1.png)

   ```yaml
   mod:
     name: 'default'
     conf:
       enabled: true
       # Device collection directories, used as specified directories for project data collection tasks and rule collection
       collect_dirs:
         - /home/bag/

       # Device monitoring directories, used as monitoring directories for project rules
       listen_dirs:
         - /home/bag/

       # Set file monitoring effectiveness: if a file's last update time is more than 2 hours from the current time, it will not be monitored by the system
       skip_period_hours: 2
   ```

3. **Create Rule**: Enter the "Project-Data Collection & Diagnosis" page to create a rule.

   ![create-rule](./img/rule_1.png)

4. **Define Rule**: Define the rule's trigger conditions and collection behavior. Here's an example rule that automatically uploads data when detecting that the /spawn_entity node status is inactive in the mcap file:
   - Message in mcap file:

     <img src={require('./img/rule_2.png').default} alt="rule_2" width="300" />

   - Rule name: Monitor /spawn_entity node status
   - Event matching condition: msg["nodes"][3]["state"] contains INACTIVE
   - Trigger actions: Collect data, Diagnose data
     - Collect data: Collect data before and after the trigger time point, save to record; collection directory is from `collect_dirs` in device configuration; file time is taken from file timestamp, if the time period to be collected overlaps with the file, the entire file will be uploaded.
     - Diagnose data: Create a moment at the trigger time point

     ![define-rule](./img/rule_3.png)
     ![define-rule](./img/rule_4.png)

5. **Confirm Rule**: Confirm that the rule is enabled and the target device has pulled the latest rule configuration.
   - Enable rule group: Click the enable button on the right of the rule group

     ![enable-rule-group](./img/rule_5.png)

   - Execute the following command on the device to check if the latest rule configuration has been pulled, looking for keywords `Updated rules`, `listen_dirs`, `collect_dirs`

     ```bash
     # View data collection client logs
     tail -f ~/.local/state/cos/logs/cos.log
     ```

     ![view-logs](./img/rule_6.png)

6. **Trigger Rule**: Create mcap file in the device's `listen_dirs` and `collect_dirs` directories to trigger the rule
   - On the device, enter `listen_dirs` and `collect_dirs` directories, execute command to download [mcap file](https://coscene-download.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sample_data/rule_sample.mcap)

     ```bash
     # Enter listen_dirs directory
     cd /home/bag/
     # Download mcap file
     wget https://coscene-download.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sample_data/rule_sample.mcap
     ```

   - Execute command to view data collection client logs, check if the rule is triggered and data is uploaded, looking for keywords `triggered`, `upload all files successfully`

     ```bash
     # View data collection client logs
     tail -f ~/.local/state/cos/logs/cos.log
     ```

     ![view-logs](./img/rule_7.png)

7. **View Collection Results**: On the "Project-Records" page, view the records automatically created by the device. Click the record name to enter details and view file and moment information. Play the record to view the collected data in the [Visualization](../viz/1-about-viz.md) page.
