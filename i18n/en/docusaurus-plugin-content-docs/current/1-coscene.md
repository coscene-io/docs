# Introduction

coScene is a platform for operations and R&D based on scene data, equivalent to the GitLab and Snowflake for the management and large-scale application of scene data. In the face of the explosive growth of multimodal data today, coScene provides an open, instantly available, cloud-native, and unbiased solution.

The company integrates the advanced models from top global AI companies with the firsthand R&D experience of several industry enterprises. It addresses the high costs and inefficiencies of complex scene data processing in industries like autonomous driving, robotics, IoT, and augmented reality. The ultimate goal is to craft cutting-edge SaaS products, aiming to lower the barriers for R&D and operations in multimodal scene intelligence, thus promoting the rapid development of the scene industry.

## Feature Overview

### Scene Data Management and Visualization

Given the challenges of large scene data dimensions, the difficulty in directly understanding raw semantics, complex and diverse data formats, varied data sources, and the complexity of data processing, coScene offers a comprehensive solution for scene data management and visualization. Users can manage scene data through APIs, web applications, and desktop software applications.

### Large-Scale Workflow Application

With coScene's workflow engine, you can conveniently build large-scale workflow applications on scene data without worrying about data preparation and computational resource scheduling. We will also launch a large-scale regression testing and validation framework in 2023, allowing users to easily track product performance changes, ensure product quality, and enhance the company's core competitiveness.

### Semantic Search Engine

coScene's semantic search engine provides an open search and discovery framework. Users can build their own scene classification library and corresponding indexes on coScene, enabling quick retrieval and discovery of scene data. This is especially useful in managing multimodal scene data. For example, in autonomous driving, users can quickly locate a specific traffic sign through the search engine, or in robotics, users can swiftly find a particular object via the search engine.
