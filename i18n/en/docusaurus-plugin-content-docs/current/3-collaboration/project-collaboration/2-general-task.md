# General Tasks
Task workflow is a crucial method of project collaboration. You can create tasks in records and assign them to team members, combining "Comments" and "Moment" features to efficiently complete collaborative workflows.

## Creating Tasks
### Creating in Records
In the record details page's "Related Tasks" module, you can view tasks associated with the record. Click the "Create" button to create a new task.

### Creating in Visualization Interface
While playing record content in the visualization interface, you can create a "Moment" to mark key frames and check "Create a New Task" to streamline work progress.

1. While playing the record, click the [Create Moment] button in the lower left corner to mark the start time point
