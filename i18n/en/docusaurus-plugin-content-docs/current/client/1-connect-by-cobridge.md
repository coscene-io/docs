# Connect to Devices coBridge

[coBridge](https://github.com/coscene-io/coBridge) is an open-source edge software provided by coScene, currently supporting **ros1** `noetic`, **ros2** `foxy` and `humble` versions. coBridge runs as a ros node on the robot side and interacts with the cloud through websocket connections. After establishing a connection with the cloud, coBridge can subscribe to ros topics and call ros services based on cloud commands, enabling real-time robot status monitoring, remote command deployment, and other functionalities.

## Prepare coBridge {#prepare-cobridge}

Please refer to [Install coScene Software Using APT](./2-apt-source-install.md) to install coBridge. Launch the ROS node afterwards.

```bash
  source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash

  # for ros 1 distribution
  roslaunch cobridge cobridge.launch

  # for ros 2 distribution
  ros2 launch cobridge cobridge_launch.xml
```
