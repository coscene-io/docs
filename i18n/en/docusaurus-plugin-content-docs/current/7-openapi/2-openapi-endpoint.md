# Get the instance endpoint

The OpenAPI platform uses `openapi` as a prefix for request addresses. Simply prepend `openapi` to your current platform address to access the OpenAPI service endpoint.

For example, if your current access platform address is `https://coscene.cn`, then the corresponding OpenAPI request address would be `https://openapi.coscene.cn`.
