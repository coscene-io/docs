# Users, Authentications, and Authorizations

Data is the most valuable asset for all coScene users. While enabling users to efficiently utilize the data, we also place significant emphasis on the security and confidentiality requirements of user data assets. From the very first day, we've been designing and building a flexible, extensible, and configurable permission model to meet our customers' confidentiality, security, and control needs.

coScene's current permission system thoroughly references the best practices in the industry and takes into account the impact of the [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) and [ABAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control) models on our application. At this stage, coScene's implementation is based on RBAC, but in upcoming releases, we will gradually introduce features of ABAC, ultimately achieving a flexible and easily understood permission setting model.

## Organizations and Projects

Serving as the permission container for the application, coScene categorizes resources into two levels. The first level is the organization. All real-world coScene users should belong to a real-world group, which is represented as an organization within coScene. While organizations do not possess actual data resources, they do have actual resource entities within the organization, such as devices and personnel, and roles are assigned to organization members at the organization level.

Organizations are also the owners of projects, and each organization can own multiple projects. As a container for data generated by users and devices, the project acts as the second layer of resource isolation within coScene. Devices produce files and records, events generated by devices and users, the flow relationship between various requests, all of which occur within the project. Some special resources have specific instances within the project, such as some private devices. If they are not convenient to be disclosed throughout the organization, they can be added and managed within the project (Note: Project-level device instances have not yet been launched; for specific launch dates, please refer to our [development plan page](../5-roadmap/1-roadmap.md)).

## Permissions and Resources

Based on the aforementioned permission system and principles, the coScene platform has predefined various actions (Action) and policies (Policy) for all resources within the system and sequentially defined template roles, as follows:

### Organization

1. Organization Administrator
2. Member
3. Read-Only Member

### Project

1. Project Administrator
2. Member
3. Read-Only Member

When a user has a role in a project, the role within that project will be prioritized for that user. This situation does not apply to administrator roles. Currently, organization administrators have the highest permissions, can access all projects, and will ignore the role settings within the project (if any).

Different predefined roles have different permissions for different resources. For a complete permission matrix, see the image below:
