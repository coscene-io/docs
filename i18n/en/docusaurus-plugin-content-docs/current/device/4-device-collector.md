# Data Collection Client Configuration

> Devices with granted access can automatically upload data to projects according to data collection rules. Collection rules apply to all devices using a shared configuration. If you need to divide collection rules by project, please refer to [About Automatic Data Collection and Diagnostics](../use-case/data-diagnosis/1-intro.md) to use the rule engine to meet your requirements.

<br />
Data collection configuration is managed by organization administrators and applies to devices with installed data collection clients within the organization. These devices automatically monitor data based on collection rules, and all organization devices share one set of collection configurations.

If you need to divide collection rules by project, please refer to [About Automatic Data Collection and Diagnostics](../use-case/data-diagnosis/1-intro.md) to use the rule engine to meet your requirements.

During collection configuration, you need to define key information such as device ID location, device monitoring directory, client initialization monitoring time range, collection directory, rule trigger topics, and client auto-update mechanism. After device access is granted, it will actively pull the organization's configured collection rule information and run dynamically on the machine end accordingly.

## Entry

On the "Devices" tab of the organization management page, click the [Edit Collection Rules] button to enter the data collection client configuration editing interface. YAML language is used for editing here.

## Collection Rule Format Details

Collection rules primarily configure 5 modules:

| Module Name | Function Description |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Data Collector Settings (collector) |  Whether to delete cache data generated by the data collection client on the device side after data collection |
| Storage Settings (mod) | Device ID storage location; monitoring directory; client initialization monitoring time range; collection directory |
| Device Event Properties (device) | Event attribute values |
| Rule Trigger Topics (topic) | Rule trigger topics |
| Update Settings (updater) | Whether to enable auto-update for the current program |

Example template as follows:

```yaml
collector:
  delete_after_interval_in_hours: 48 # By default, cache data generated by the data collection client on the device side will be automatically deleted after 48 hours, -1 means no deletion

mod:
  # mod name, default is 'default', supports monitoring files in specified device directories
  # For custom monitoring methods, please contact coScene
  name: 'default'

  conf:
    # Enable switch, true/false, enabled by default
    enabled: true

    # Assuming there's a file /home/coscene/example.yaml on the machine end with content:
    # serial_num: 1234
    #
    # Then during machine registration, it will read the serial_num field value (1234) from example.yaml as the machine's unique identifier
    sn_file: /home/coscene/example.yaml
    sn_field: serial_num

    # Device monitoring directories, used as rule monitoring directories in projects
    listen_dirs:
      - /home/bag/

    # Files won't be monitored/collected when the time difference between current time and file update time exceeds {skip_period_hours}
    skip_period_hours: 2

    # Device collection directories, used as specified directories for project data collection tasks and rule collection
    collect_dirs:
      - /home/bag/
      - /home/log/

# Assuming there's a file /home/coscene/device.yaml on the machine end with content:
# soft_version: v1.0
#
# After device rule triggering, it will read soft_version: v1.0 from device.yaml as the generated event's attribute value
# To view the event statistics panel, please contact coScene
device:
  extra_files:
    - /home/coscene/device1.yaml
    - /home/coscene/device2.yaml

# Topics serve as options for rule trigger topics in projects to narrow down rule matching scope
# Assuming there's an error_code topic
topics:
  - error_code

# Auto update
updater:
  # Auto update switch, true/false, disabled by default
  enabled: false
```

Let's go through each function and its usage:

### Data Collector Settings (collector)

This module is used to configure whether to delete device-end data after collection is complete, effectively managing device storage. Configurable parameters include:

- `delete_after_upload`: Default value is false. If set to true, device-end data will be deleted after upload.

- `delete_after_interval_in_hours`: # By default, cache data generated by the data collection client on the device side will be automatically deleted after 48 hours, -1 means no deletion

- `scan_interval_in_secs`: Default value is 60, meaning the folder is scanned every 60 seconds.

```yaml
# Data collector settings
collector:
  delete_after_upload: true # Default value is false
  delete_after_interval_in_hours: 48 # By default, cache data generated by the data collection client on the device side will be automatically deleted after 48 hours, -1 means no deletion
  scan_interval_in_secs: 60 # Default value: 60, scans folder every 60s
```

### Storage Settings (mod)

Mainly responsible for configuring device-end data storage location information:

- `name`: Default name is `default`, supports monitoring files in specified device directories. For custom monitoring methods, please contact coScene.

- `conf`: Enable switch, `true/false`, enabled by default.

- `sn_file`: Assuming there's a corresponding file on the machine end (e.g., `/home/coscene/example.yaml`) containing a unique device identifier (e.g., `serial_num: 1234`), during machine registration, it will read the specified field value (`1234`) as the machine's unique identifier.

- `sn_field`: Corresponding identifier field name.

- `listen_dirs`: Device monitoring directories, used as rule monitoring directories in projects.

- `collect_dirs`: Device collection directories, used as specified directories for project data collection tasks and rule collection.

```yaml
mod:
  # mod name, default is 'default', supports monitoring files in specified device directories
  # For custom monitoring methods, please contact coScene
  name: 'default'

  conf:
    # Enable switch, true/false, enabled by default
    enabled: true

    # Assuming there's a file /home/coscene/example.yaml on the machine end with content:
    # serial_num: 1234
    #
    # Then during machine registration, it will read the serial_num field value (1234) from example.yaml as the machine's unique identifier
    sn_file: /home/coscene/example.yaml
    sn_field: serial_num

    # Device monitoring directories, used as rule monitoring directories in projects
    listen_dirs:
      - /home/bag/

    # Files won't be monitored/collected when the time difference between current time and file update time exceeds {skip_period_hours}
    skip_period_hours: 2

    # Device collection directories, used as specified directories for project data collection tasks and rule collection
    collect_dirs:
      - /home/bag/
      - /home/log/
```

### Device Event Properties (device)

Assuming there's a specific file on the machine end (e.g., `/home/coscene/device.yaml` with content `soft_version: v1.0`), after device rule triggering, it will read the specified content (e.g., `soft_version: v1.0`) as the generated event's attribute value. Additional related files can be configured through `extra_files`.

```yaml
# Assuming there's a file /home/coscene/device.yaml on the machine end with content:
# soft_version: v1.0
#
# After device rule triggering, it will read soft_version: v1.0 from device.yaml as the generated event's attribute value
# To view the event statistics panel, please contact coScene
device:
  extra_files:
    - /home/coscene/device1.yaml
    - /home/coscene/device2.yaml
```

### Rule Trigger Topics (topic)

Topics serve as options for rule trigger topics in projects, helping narrow down rule matching scope and improve monitoring efficiency. For example, assuming there's an `error_code` topic:

```yaml
# Topics serve as options for rule trigger topics in projects to narrow down rule matching scope
# Assuming there's an error_code topic
topics:
  - error_code
```

### Update Settings (updater)

Used to configure whether to auto-update the data collection client. Default is `false` (no auto-update). If changed to `true`, the device will automatically update when connected to the internet after we release a new version of the data collection client.

```yaml
# Auto update
updater:
  # Auto update switch, true/false, disabled by default
  enabled: false
```
