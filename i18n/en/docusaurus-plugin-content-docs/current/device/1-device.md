# About Devices

Devices serve two primary purposes: first, as a basic piece of information for records, indicating the source of the data; second, as an object for automatic data collection, connecting with the real device end. Device information can be attached to records, allowing for retrieval and statistics of data uploaded by the device.

## Basic Elements

Devices mainly consist of 4 basic elements:

- ID: The unique identifier for the device.
- Name: Custom name for the device, such as an alias that's easier to recognize than the ID.
- Store: The location where the device operates.
- Model: The type or model of the device.
