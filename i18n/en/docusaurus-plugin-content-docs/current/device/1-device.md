# About Devices

**In the coScene Spatiotemporal Data Platform, devices serve two key functions:**

- Act as carriers of basic record information, clearly identifying data sources
- Connect with real device endpoints as targets for data collection, allowing device information to be added to relevant records for precise retrieval and comprehensive statistics of data uploaded by the device
  <br />

**The platform is divided into two modules: Organization Devices and Project Devices:**

- Organization Devices: Used for unified management of all devices within an organization
- Project Devices: Allocated from organization devices to various projects; one organization device can be added to multiple projects but corresponds to the same physical device

## Basic Elements

Devices contain 3 basic elements:
| Field Name | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| Device ID | Also known as the SN number, it is the unique identifier for devices in the platform |
| Name | Custom device name, such as an alias that's easier to identify than the ID |
| Client Status | Status information exists when a device is registered through client installation; no related information when added by filling in information |
