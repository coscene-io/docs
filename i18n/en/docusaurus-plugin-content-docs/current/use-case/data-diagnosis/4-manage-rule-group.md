# Managing Rule

## Enable

Before using a rule group, it needs to be enabled. Once a rule group is enabled, the rules within the group will then become active.
If the rules in the rule group are temporarily not needed in certain scenarios, the rule group can also be disabled.

An enabled rule group will be shown in blue in the rule group status list, while a disabled rule group will appear grayed out.

To enable/disable a rule group:

- Go to the "Device - Rules & matching" page, select the rule group, and toggle the corresponding **[Status]** button.

- Go to the "Device - Rules & matching" page, select the rule you want to edit, and click the rule name.
