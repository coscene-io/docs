      open-source models. You should independently assess the risks associated with
      using open-source models and ensure that they meet your business needs. If you
      violate the open-source license agreements or relevant laws and regulations,
      resulting in any complaints, claims, or legal liabilities for Spatious, you
      shall be responsible for resolving the issues and bearing the related costs and
